# DismissibleImageView

This is one of my favourite UX patterns which is currently being used in the Twitter app. The idea is simple, click an image for a full screen view then just move the image off the screen to go back to your previous view.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/sample.gif"/> 
</p>

I know this is a really simple library BUT it would be nice if more apps started adopting this kind of UX patterns that make the Android experience a little bit more enjoyable. And as I'm writting this I think I may create a few other libraries for other simple UX an UI patterns that might make your app's experience a little better.

## Installation

Add this in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
```
  allprojects {
    repositories {
      ...
      maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
  }
```
Then add the dependency to your app's build.gradle.

```
  compile 'com.github.thedude61636:DismissibleImageView:1.0.1'
```


## How to use

Instead of using ImageViews just use DismissibleImageView and you're good to go:

```xml
<com.dmallcott.dismissibleimageview.DismissibleImageView
        android:id="@+id/activity_main_dismissibleImageView"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content" />
```

Keep in mind that for the moment it will keep `adjustViewBounds` as true by default. This is because I'm working with bitmaps by default and I was too lazy to remove the extra space manually. I will definitely fix that later.
